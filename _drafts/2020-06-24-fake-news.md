This photo that claims to be a NASA satellite photo of India on the night of Diwali has been popping up on WhatsApp and social media periodically since 2012. The photo is actually a composite of multiple images designed to show population growth, and has nothing to do with Diwali or NASA.

###### Most people know the photo is fake because by now it has become something of a joke. But it's quite easy to see why someone would believe it—it looks real, and people tend to trust what they see.

January 2020 started with news articles massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word 'apocalyptic' came to mind. If you're the sort of person who believes in omens, this looked like one.

Closer to home, there were protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (which later became the Citizenship Amendment Act) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). There were protests across India, including at Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi where police forcibly entered the campus and used batons and tear gas on students.[^1] This act of police brutality lead to further protests across universities in India, including the IIT Bombay campus. I read the news each day with a deepening sense of discomfort about the direction things were going in, and felt angry and powerless like many other people at the time.

A number of students bodies on the campus came together around December 2019 and began organising a collective response under the name of IIT Bombay for Justice. Following Ambedkar's slogan of educate, agitate and organize, we started with creating pamphlets and posters explaining the CAA and NRC and why it was problematic. These were shared online on WhatsApp and other social media, and also printed and distributed at protests inside and outside the campus. The IIT Bombay for Justice collective also organised a daily vigil in solidarity with Jamia, and a lecture series about the constitution.

###### Test print of the English pamphlet. I worked with other members of IIT Bombay for Justice to design similiar pamphlets in English, Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Urdu, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu — my first time typesetting in most of these languages.

The media and people's opinions quickly became extremely polarised. I found myself in arguments with relatives, finding myself unable to stay quiet when someone said something clearly prejudiced on the family WhatsApp group. Tensions were high even within students on campus. There was a march for “National Unity and Peace” organised by those who sided with the government, which had chants including the now famous “गोली मारो सालों को” (shoot the bastards) slogan. Many students seemed to not care either way, but insisted that they were ‘neutral’ and did not agree that anyone should be protesting on campus. The common view seemed to be that it was mostly the M.Tech and PHd students from the Humanities and Social Sciences departments who were ‘ruining the reputation of the institute’ and the biggest concern for them seemed to be that this could hurt placements. This sort of blind acceptance of authority, and ignorance and even derision towards the social sciences is unfortunately common in Engineering colleges. We found our posters regularly defaced or removed from the notice boards, and the IIT Bombay admistration (seemingly worried about government retaliation) tended to use bureaucratic measures to stifle student protests. When we complained about our posters being taken down, there was suddenly a new rule that required prior permission for posting anything on any notice board.

I was trying to find a direction for my final semester research and design projects, but felt like I couldn't just ignore what was happening around me. Designers position themselves as ‘problem-solvers’ and yet here was a problem I could seemingly do nothing about. I was also growing wary of how much misinformation was floating around on social media about the protests—my own aunt refused to believe that the protests on my campus that I was part of were organised by students, insisting that some external elements were paying people to cause trouble. I had also realised that the pamphlets we made seemed to be spreading faster on WhatsApp than any other medium, and I started to think that the spread of misinformation on WhatsApp could be explored from the lens of Human-Computer Interactions. 




The internet has changed how humans communicate with each other. The world has become a smaller place, and anyone with a smartphone in their hands has a potential audience of thousands, if not lakhs of people. This democratisation of content creation has opened up avenues for individuals and smaller publications, and and has given a voice to people who might never have have found an audience with traditional media. Traditional media like print, radio or television have an inherent limit require significant capital investment to set up a publication, and this inadverdently made media houses the middlemen who controlled who could share content through these platforms. The internet changed this equation by allowing people to create and share content with very little investment. It is free to create a blog or a YouTube channel, or to post on social media, and people can even earn money by putting up ads next to content that they produce. Online media is often faster to cover issues and is cheaper to access than traditional media, and can be shared with others to start discussions. This opening up of communication media, however, has come with it’s fair share of challenges. The gatekeeping of traditional media outlets limited who got an audience, but it also usually ensured journalistic rigour and high standards for fact-checking. 

The advent of social media has turned communication into a free-for-all. There is a flattening effect where information from reliable sources shares the same look and feel as well as shelf space as content from friends, family and acquaintances or worse—bad actors like fake news or propaganda accounts. Recommendation algorithms that favour emotionally driven, sensational content with clickbait style headlines, combined with the network effects of social sharing can turn anything into the next viral story.

In 2016, the Oxford dictionary named ‘post-truth’ the Word of the Year. The term refers to the “slippage between facts or alt-facts, knowledge, opinion, belief, and truth“ [^2] that had started to dominate the global political discourse—from the 2016 US Presidential elections, to Brexit, to demonetisation in India. In a post-truth world the conversations are dominated by opinions and appeals to emotion, and the facts are often secondary or don’t seem to matter at all. At the same time, there is an increasing polarisation of public opinion—often attributed to social media and the echo chambers it can create. [^3] This makes misinformation an issue that cuts across
domains such as politics, journalism, technology, public policy, law enforcement and education. Research in
the domain has also come from many domains—from psychologists trying to understand how misinformation
impacts the creation of memories [^4] , to computer scientists finding ways to use machine learning to build fake news
classifiers [^5] . There have thus been a number of different approaches to tackling misinformation—from games that aim to improve media literacy by teaching people
about how misinformation is created, to dedicated fact-checking websites. The conflicting challenges of
freedom of speech, open access to platforms make misinformation a wicked problem which is difficult to tackle completely with any one approach.
However, all of this work is promising—the birth of the fact-checking movement and digital news activism, the rise of data journalism and persistence of quality journalism with high ethical standards is a heartening reminder that people still fundamentally care about the truth.
