#### Own your work

##### Be excellent to each other. 
People remember how they feel more than what they did. 
##### Feedback is a gift
Someone taking out time to help you get better with actionable advice is doing you a favor. Don’t get defensive, listen with open ears and judge later.
##### Give away your legos

3/ the reward for good work is more work

4/ people don’t leave companies, they leave managers

5/ manage up, get face time

6/ A players hire A players, B players hire C players: once you start bringing in the B team, its only a few months before C players outnumber your A players. once that happens, it's unlikely your A players want to stick around.

7/ burnout = how much you care / how much you can control

8/ no substitute for reps, reps, reps: probably the biggest reason the hardest workers get ahead

9/ management is its own skill: it's not just being a really, really good practitioner

10/ growth buries the bodies: IMO a feature, not a bug, best to keep chugging along if its working

11/ HR exists to protect the company

12/ 

13/ squeaky wheels get the grease: managers default spend the most time on underperformers, teammates have to do overtime to cover dropped balls (on not only the work itself, but also the delicate communication required around it)



15/ if you want to go fast, go alone. if you want to go far, go together.

16/ repetition doesn't spoil the prayer
