#### About this site

I've been fascinated by the idea of Digital Gardens for some time now. I really enjoy Andy Matuschak's [working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/), where he writes personal notes but shares them publicly. He calls this [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up)). 

I like the idea of writing for myself but making my notes publicly accessible in case they are useful for other people. My goals with this website are two-fold.

1. I want a portfolio to document my work as a designer, which means my home page shows only the projects that show the skills most relevant to my career as a UX Designer.
2. I want a place to write personal reflections, collect useful resources, document personal projects, make notes about things I learned. These can be a little esoteric—I have a page for my grandfather's [Ginger Beer](/ginger-beer) recipe, and a page about [Numeronyms](/numeronyms). 

#### Typography

This site uses Besley for headings, and IBM Plex Serif italics for article subtitles. All body text is set in the system font, and changes based on the operating system being used.

#### Website Setup

I used a custom Jekyll theme for my old website, and I am now experimenting with Obsidian as a writing interface combined with Jekyll and GitHub Pages for hosting.

The rest of this page is filler content with every type of content my blog supports, in order to make sure everything is working if I change any styles.

#### Image carousel

I created a custom carousel component for this blog. It's a bit wonky right now.
